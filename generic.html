								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am a recent graduate of Claremont McKenna College. I played Division 3 Basketball for my four years, developing strong leadership skills and a talented network of Claremont McKenna and Harvey Mudd graduates.  </p>
								<p>As a recent graduate of Claremont McKenna College, and a four-year leader on our basketball team, I am a “glue-guy” with experience in strategy implementation, goal setting and servant leadership. As a Senior Staff Intern at the Reagan Foundation, I was trusted to coordinate the Nancy Reagan Centennial, develop the library’s website on Reaganomics, create an in-person Student Leadership Program during COVID, and schedule leading financial executives and heads of U.S Military branches for the Reagan National Defense Forum. At a digital media startup, I implemented Google Analytics to bolster sales presentations with outdoor retailers like Bass Pro Shops. Additionally, I led a comprehensive online strategy for a heavily contested State Senate Campaign in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
								<p>I have lived in Argentina and Sweden. I am an avid outdoorsman and often trek up to the Mammoth Lakes to camp and fish. Although I no longer play collegiately, you can find me playing pickup hoops at whatever court is around. </p>
								<p>I started my career as a Financial Advisor, but the company and overall industry did not match my desire for growth. While I excel in sales and relationship management, I want my work to push me beyond my skills. This drive is the motivation for this site, but also the center focus of my professional search. I invite you to reach out and learn more about me! </p>
